This simple method divides your after-tax income into three categories:

- Groceries
- Insurance
- Minimum debt payments

**30% - Wants (Discretionary Spending)**
- Entertainment
- Dining out
- Hobbies
- Shopping
- Travel

**20% - Savings and Debt Repayment**
- Emergency fund
- Retirement savings
- Extra debt payments
- Other savings goals

**Example with $5,000 monthly income:**
- Needs: $2,500
- Wants: $1,500
- Savings/Debt: $1,000

### Zero-Based Budget

Every dollar is assigned a purpose before the month begins.

**Steps:**
1. List your monthly income
2. List all expenses and savings goals
3. Assign every dollar to a category
4. Income - Expenses = Zero
